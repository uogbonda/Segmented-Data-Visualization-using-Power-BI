# Segmented-Data-Visualization-using-Power-BI
The segmented data set has various columns which are year, country, products, territory, unit price, sales, quantity etc. Using PowerBI to visualize the data for an easy understanding of how the products sales in different territories are performing and much more.
The tables also is a slicer for the data visualization. This is just a simple example....better dashboards could be created of course.



Second segmented display is better than the segmented display. Notice that there are errors in both of them. The Sales , unit price and all other values representing money needed a currency to know that they are monetary values.


The Segmented Dashborad is a poor representation of product dashboard. It is ok to start with it but as you keep practicing the dashboards improve.


Microsoft POWER BI

Importing the data from the Web, Excel etc, during the data importation; you can transform the data. If preferred working on the data in Excel before importing it to Power BI. Editing the data set in Excel is easier if you are not familiar with the Power BI.
